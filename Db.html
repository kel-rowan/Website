      I got into dragon ball about 2 years ago during the start of the Dragon Ball Legend 5th anniversary. I think Dragon Ball is so cool man, the story is amazing and the attacks are so awesome and there are so many cool moments! I love the themes of progression and working hard. The games are really fun too and the lore is cool! The animation is amazing aswell. I hope the war for the DB rights in japan get resolved soon so we can get more content. RIP Akira Toriyama the creator of Dragon Ball.</p>
