    <p class="vocaloid">

      i began listening to vocaloid a couple years ago, but i really got into it end of last year, and ive never gone back, teto is my favorite my fav song is either Machine Love or Meltdown. I love how community driven vocaloid is, the community songs really build the story of the characters and the community is awesome! Everyone feels so close like everyone knows everyone. :3 The songs are bangers too, I reccomend looking at Jamie Page's music.
