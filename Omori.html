    <p class= vocaloid> I got into omori about the tail end of 2020. It was very comforting because i was going through something at the time. Omori is still very comforting to me, I get a warm feeling when playing or seeing content about the game. Kel is my favorite character :3. The story is amazing, with such thought out characters that really get you attached to them, and the way it pulls on your heartstrings too!. And the community is welcoming and amazing! I strive to have an omori friend group.</p>
